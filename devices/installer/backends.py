"""
Backends — per-platform skill deploy primitives.

Each backend exposes the same interface so the installer orchestrator
(shim.py) can pick at runtime without conditionals everywhere. rsync is
the Linux/Mac choice; Windows will get a separate backend (probably
robocopy or a Python copy_tree wrapper) when the first Windows box is
brought up.
