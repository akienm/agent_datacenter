# context-load — Session startup

## Step 0.25 — Stale slate check (soft prompt to close previous day)
```bash
python3 ~/TheIgors/lab/claudecode/stale_slate_check.py
```

Soft prompt — when the most-recent prior-day slate has open items in
`## Next up`, `## Blocked`, or `## After that` AND lacks a `✅ CLOSED`
marker, the check emits a warning. Silent when the prior slate is fully
closed, empty, or doesn't exist.

When the warning fires, always surface it to Akien and offer: run
`/day-close` on the stale date, defer, or skip. Soft prompt, not a gate —
Akien decides.

## Step 0.5 — Debug flag
```bash
touch ~/.TheIgors/Igor-wild-0001/debug_session.flag
```

## Step 1 — Today's slate

Always ensure today's slate exists — context-load creates one when the
current day has no file yet:
```bash
SLATE=~/.TheIgors/claudecode/$(date +%Y%m%d).slate.txt
if [ ! -f "$SLATE" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SLATE")"
  cat > "$SLATE" <<EOF
# Slate $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Notes

## In-flight
NONE

## Planned

## Ad hoc

## Done today
EOF
fi
cat "$SLATE"
```

Section order is salience-first (D-slate-salience-order-2026-04-20): read
top-down, stop once you have enough context. Notes = short-term reminders
(carry forward N days, drop when stale — kept at top so they're actually
read); In-flight = what's mid-work; Planned = what to pick up next; Ad hoc
= today's reactive additions; Done today = shipped.

## Step 2a — Rules (hash-gated; read these FIRST when changed)

Always check the rules hash before reading — the rules only reload when
something changed since last session:
```bash
HASH_FILE=~/.TheIgors/claudecode/rules_hash.txt
CURRENT_HASH=$(psql postgresql://igor:choose_a_password@127.0.0.1/Igor-wild-0001 -tAc \
  "SELECT md5(string_agg(path || '|' || coalesce(content,''), '||' ORDER BY path))
   FROM memory_palace WHERE path LIKE 'theigors/rules/%'")
SAVED_HASH=$(cat "$HASH_FILE" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ "$CURRENT_HASH" = "$SAVED_HASH" ]; then
  echo "rules: unchanged since last session (hash=${CURRENT_HASH:0:8}...) — skipping full load"
else
  echo "rules: changed (${SAVED_HASH:0:8}... → ${CURRENT_HASH:0:8}...) — loading"
  psql postgresql://igor:choose_a_password@127.0.0.1/Igor-wild-0001 -c \
    "SELECT title, content FROM memory_palace
     WHERE path LIKE 'theigors/rules/%' ORDER BY path" -tA
  echo "$CURRENT_HASH" > "$HASH_FILE"
fi
```

Canonical rules live in the palace DB (T-rules-canonical-db-first, 2026-04-20).
CLAUDE.md is a thin shim — palace wins on conflict. Read order: persona →
coding → commits → memory → database → budget → collaboration →
igor-constraints → docs-live-in-code → do-not.

## Step 2b — Memory palace tree (hash-gated)
```bash
TREE_HASH_FILE=~/.TheIgors/claudecode/palace_tree_hash.txt
CURRENT_TREE_HASH=$(psql postgresql://igor:choose_a_password@127.0.0.1/Igor-wild-0001 -tAc \
  "SELECT md5(string_agg(path || '|' || coalesce(title,''), '||' ORDER BY path)) FROM memory_palace")
SAVED_TREE_HASH=$(cat "$TREE_HASH_FILE" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ "$CURRENT_TREE_HASH" = "$SAVED_TREE_HASH" ]; then
  echo "palace tree: unchanged (hash=${CURRENT_TREE_HASH:0:8}...) — skipping listing"
else
  psql postgresql://igor:choose_a_password@127.0.0.1/Igor-wild-0001 -c \
    "SELECT path, title FROM memory_palace ORDER BY path" -t
  echo "$CURRENT_TREE_HASH" > "$TREE_HASH_FILE"
fi
```

The palace is the navigable map. Each node is a signpost — title + pointer
to where the real info lives (code, DB, tools, docs).

Always use the MCP tools to query specific nodes during a session:
```
memory_get(path="theigors/rules/coding")       # exact node read
memory_search(query="...")                     # topic lookup
memory_list_by_type(type="RULE")               # typed listing
```
The raw psql path remains available for bulk operations, but `memory_get`
is the frictionless default for single-node reads in a working session.

## Step 3 — Decisions hot window (last 10)
```bash
tail -10 ~/TheIgors/lab/design_docs_for_igor/decisions_log.dsb | sed 's/|/ — /g'
```

## Step 4 — Channel (last 5)

Always use the MCP channel read for this — matches how other sessions and
Igor himself read the channel, stays consistent across machines:
```
mcp__igor__channel_read(limit=5)
```
Fallback (shared Postgres channel, all machines):
```bash
python3 ~/TheIgors/lab/claudecode/channel.py read 5
```

## Step 5 — Pending approvals
```bash
python3 ~/TheIgors/lab/claudecode/cc_queue.py list 2>/dev/null | grep "🟠"
```

## Step 5.6 — Unread CC inbox

Always check the inbox — pushes from Igor subsystems (pe_chain escalations,
scope_guard blocks, go-live-when trips) land here and need surfacing:
```bash
python3 -c "
from lab.claudecode.cc_inbox import read_unread
entries = read_unread()
if entries:
    high = sum(1 for e in entries if e.urgency == 'high')
    needs_reply = sum(1 for e in entries if e.response_expected)
    print(f'Inbox: {len(entries)} unread ({high} high, {needs_reply} need reply)')
    for e in entries[:5]:
        urg = '!' if e.urgency == 'high' else '·' if e.urgency == 'low' else ' '
        tk = f' [{e.ticket_id}]' if e.ticket_id else ''
        print(f'  [{urg}] {e.kind}{tk}: {e.summary}')
else:
    print('Inbox: empty')
"
```

When unread exists, always surface the summary to Akien, then invoke
/readinbox to see full details and mark-read.

## Step 6 — Assemble briefing

Always stay inside the 2000-token (~8000-char) budget. Output shape:
```
CONTEXT LOAD — <timestamp>
In-flight: <## In-flight line from slate, or NONE>
Active: <ticket IDs from slate>
Palace: <node count + top-level branches>
Decisions: <one-line from tail>
Channel: <recent or "quiet">
[~NNN tokens]
Ready.
```

## Hard rules
- Always stay within the 2000-token budget.
- Per-blob read cap: 40 lines.
- When a question maps to a palace branch, always read that node first (`memory_get(path=...)`) — palace-first over codebase grep.
- Palace is the index; code is the truth. When palace says X and code says Y, trust the code and update the palace.
