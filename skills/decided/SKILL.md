# /decided — Close a design block → batch tickets

The closing mark of a design conversation. Takes "the stuff we just talked about" and makes it durable — decisions in the palace, tickets in the queue, everything linked.

## Inputs

- Optional arg: a brief one-line summary, e.g. `/decided rename audit to day-close-audit`. If omitted, infer the summary from the scope.
- Scope boundary — look back to whichever is most recent:
  1. A `DESIGN_START` marker (written by /design), OR
  2. The most recent prior /decided boundary, OR
  3. The session start.

## Steps

### 1. Determine scope

Always identify where the design block begins before drafting tickets — the
scope sets which turns feed each decision.

```bash
grep -E "^(- D-|## In-flight|## Notes|DESIGN_START)" ~/.TheIgors/claudecode/$(date +%Y%m%d).slate.txt | tail -20
```

Pick whichever boundary appears most recently: DESIGN_START, prior /decided,
or session start. When no prior boundary exists, treat the whole conversation
as scope.

### 2. Summarize the decision

Always write a one-to-two sentence summary and assign a decision id of the
form `D-<kebab-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD`. A decision without a D-id can't be
rolled up or traced back from the tickets it spawned.

### 2.5. Audit the design (audit-design)

Always invoke `audit-design` on the decision summary + scope context before
drafting tickets. The audit runs nine positive checks (positive-target goal,
runtime-observable success, alternatives considered, constraints named,
"what am I missing" pass, conflicts with last-30d decisions, palace-rule
conflicts, scope decomposition, executor + inertia per piece) and returns:

- **PASS** → proceed to Step 3.
- **AMEND** → apply the listed amendments to the decision narrative (ask
  Akien if any are ambiguous), then re-run `audit-design`. Do not draft
  tickets until the audit returns PASS.
- **HIGH-inertia surface** → audit-design separately flags HIGH-inertia
  files mentioned in the narrative; pause for Akien pre-approval before
  proceeding, even on PASS.

Standalone re-check is supported via `/audit-design <decision-id>` after
the decision has been filed.

### 3. Draft tickets

For each implementation unit the decision implies, draft one ticket shaped
per the `/ticket` description template:
```python
{
  "id": "T-<kebab-slug>",
  "title": "<short title, <80 chars>",
  "size": "S|M|L|XL",
  "tags": ["<Topic>", "<Area>"],
  "description": "<problem + proposed shape + Affected files + Design rules + Scope boundary + Test plan>",
  "decision_id": "D-...",
  "gate": null,  # set if depends on another pending ticket
  "priority": 0.5  # raise for unblockers
}
```

### 4. Run /audit-ticket on each draft

Always invoke /audit-ticket once per drafted ticket — filing-time quality is the
whole point of /decided. /audit-ticket returns one of:
- **PASS** → proceed to filing.
- **AMEND** → apply the amendments (ask Akien if ambiguous), re-submit.
- **SPLIT** → replace the single draft with N child drafts; run /audit-ticket on each.
- **DISCARD** → drop the draft; record the reason in the decision narrative.

When /audit-ticket flags a HIGH-inertia touch, always surface it inline for
Akien's pre-approval. Stamp the approval into the ticket body before filing
— that stamp survives compaction; CC's memory does not.

### 5. File the tickets

Write the post-review batch to `/tmp/decided_batch_<decision-id>.json`, then
append to the queue:
```bash
python3 ~/TheIgors/lab/claudecode/cc_queue.py add /tmp/decided_batch_<decision-id>.json
```
`cc_queue.py` is the canonical writer — always go through it so the slate
echo and session record stay consistent.

### 6. Write to Igor memory palace

Always create a decision node so the rollup loop can find it. Until
`T-decisions-into-palace-subtree` ships the palace writer, drop a file stub
at `lab/design_docs/decisions/D-....md`:
```markdown
# D-<id>
**title:** <one-line summary>
**date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**status:** open
**spawned_tickets:** T-x, T-y, T-z

## Decision narrative
<1-2 sentences from step 2 + context from the conversation scope>
```

Fields expected on the palace node (same shape):
- `title` — one-line decision summary
- `content` — decision narrative (summary + scope context)
- `spawned_tickets` — list of ticket ids created
- `date` — YYYY-MM-DD
- `status` — `open` (auto-closes when all spawned_tickets close, via decision-rollup)

### 7. Append to decisions log

Chronological append (this is the exception to "don't write to
decisions_log.dsb directly" — /decided is a structured writer, not a blind
dump; the file becomes a generated echo once the palace migration ships):
```bash
echo "$(date -Iseconds) | D-... | <summary> | tickets: T-x, T-y, T-z" >> ~/TheIgors/lab/design_docs_for_igor/decisions_log.dsb
```

### 8. Append to slate

```bash
echo "- $D_ID: <summary> — T-x, T-y, T-z" >> ~/.TheIgors/claudecode/$(date +%Y%m%d).slate.txt
```

### 9. Clear /design flag (if set)

```bash
rm -f ~/.TheIgors/cc_channel/design_mode.json
```

### 10. Report

```
/decided <summary> — D-...
Tickets filed: T-x, T-y, T-z (<N> total)
All linked to D-... (two-way navigation via decision_id field + decision's spawned_tickets list)
```

## Flow integration

Design pattern:
```
/design (optional)
  → conversation turns (may include back-and-forth, questions, exploration)
/decided <summary>
  → tickets filed, decision recorded, design block closes
/sprint-batch decision:D-...
  → sprints all tickets from this decision
```

Multiple decisions in one session:
```
/design
  → discuss topic A
/decided A — T-a1, T-a2
  → discuss topic B
/decided B — T-b1
  → discuss topic C
/decided C — T-c1, T-c2, T-c3
/sprint-batch today-slate
  → sprints all 6 tickets across the three decisions
```

## Invariants

- Every decision gets a D-id, even single-ticket ones — makes trace navigable.
- Every ticket in a /decided batch carries `decision_id` — no orphaned tickets.
- /audit-ticket runs on EVERY draft, not just the first or biggest.
- HIGH-inertia approvals land in the ticket body before filing; they are not kept in CC's conversational memory.

## Hard rules

- Always run /audit-ticket on every drafted ticket — filing-time quality is the whole point.
- DISCARD verdicts from /audit-ticket block filing until Akien explicitly overrides.
- Every distinct decision gets its own D-id. Single-session doesn't mean single-decision.
- Decisions are append-only. New context becomes a new decision, linked via metadata.
