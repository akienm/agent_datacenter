# /export-chat — Dump current chat to markdown

Recovery snapshot. If something scrolls off the top of the chat, `/export-chat` gives you a durable copy on disk.

## Steps

Run the helper script (default target is the most-recently-modified transcript — i.e. the current session):

```bash
python3 /home/akien/TheIgors/lab/claudecode/export_chat.py
```

Output: `/home/akien/TheIgors/claude_chat_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Overwrites today's file; appends with a separator if the same day already has content from a different session.

## Flags

- `--session <session-id>` — render a specific session by id (the UUID filename minus `.jsonl`).
- `--all` — render every transcript in `~/.claude/projects/-home-akien-TheIgors/*.jsonl`, each to its corresponding day's file. Idempotent — running multiple times just appends separators.
- `--dry-run` — print what would be written, don't touch disk.

## What it renders

- User turns and assistant turns with timestamps.
- Tool calls: rendered as inline one-liners like `_[tool: Bash({"command":"..."})]_`.
- Tool results: elided to first 200 chars so the log stays readable.

## What it skips

- Empty / system-reminder / hook messages.
- Full tool result bodies (too noisy for a recovery log — the goal is "remember what we talked about", not reconstruct every command output).

## When to run

- Anytime you see the chat approaching its visible scroll limit and you want insurance.
- Before `/compact`, so you have the pre-compact state preserved.
- End of session (though `/savestate` covers the structured summary; `/export-chat` covers the verbatim transcript).
