"""
Rack-level health and enumeration functions.

These are the implementations behind the rack.* MCP tools. Extracted from
Skeleton to keep the MCP registration code thin and these functions directly
testable without going through FastMCP.

Health rationale: no background heartbeat. Health is a question, not a process.
Poll when you need the answer; callers decide how often. On-demand parallel
fan-out with asyncio.gather() + per-device timeout avoids cascading delays when
a device is slow or unreachable.
