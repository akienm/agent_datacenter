"""
Router — comms:// URI resolver and message dispatcher.

The comms:// scheme is the only addressing layer in agent_datacenter. Callers are
topology-blind: they address by name; the router handles IMAP APPEND dispatch.

Pub/sub falls out naturally from IMAP IDLE: comms://Shared → all IDLE subscribers
receive the message when they next poll or wake from IDLE. No separate pub/sub
layer is needed.

URI shape:
    comms://{mailbox_name}[.{surface}[.{sub-surface}...]]

The mailbox_name is the registered IMAP folder. Optional dot-separated
suffix segments after a registered mailbox name carry surface qualifiers
(e.g. comms://akiendelllinux.1.console resolves to mailbox akiendelllinux.1
with surface='console'). The router peels suffixes longest-prefix-wins
until a registered mailbox matches.

Examples:
    comms://Shared                       → mailbox Shared
    comms://CC.0                         → mailbox CC.0
    comms://igor-wild-0001               → mailbox igor-wild-0001
    comms://igor-wild-0001.console       → mailbox igor-wild-0001 (surface=console)
    comms://akiendelllinux.1             → mailbox akiendelllinux.1
    comms://akiendelllinux.1.inference   → mailbox akiendelllinux.1 (surface=inference)
